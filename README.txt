The point of this little script is to import a map, allow the teacher to click
around at various points on the map, and create a question for each one of the
points. Then it should produce a bunch of different versions of a quiz that will
allow you to test students on the features marked.

This is in the very preliminary stages of completion. Most of the heavy lifting
in the code has been done by Anthropic's Claude.
