I am a high school teacher in math and humanities. I am a big fan of paper 
quizzes and also the practice of giving students as many cracks at any parti-
cular formative assessment as they need to get the answers right. But I also 
want them randomized to eliminate as much as possible the memorization of a 
particular instrument.

The point of this little script is to import a map, allow the teacher to click
around at various points on the map, and create a question for each one of the
points. Then it should produce a bunch of different versions of a quiz (as many
as you ask it to) that will allow you to test students on the features marked.
It could conceivably be used to generate quizzes for any type of image identifi-
cation: maps, anatomy charts, artwork, etc, etc.

This is in the very preliminary stages of completion. Most of the heavy lifting
in the code has been done by Anthropic's Claude and ChatGPT.
